## How to contribute to brawnzaa-client

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead [email directly](dev@brawnzaa.com).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/matjack9/brawnzaa-client/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/matjack9/brawnzaa-client/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch and a spec expressing the new behavior.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of brawnzaa-client will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change via [email](dev@brawnzaa.com) and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
